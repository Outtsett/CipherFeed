# VPOC & Value Area Movement Signals - Complete Reference

**Purpose**: Interpret what different VPOC and Value Area (VAH/VAL) movements mean for trading signals

**Format**: Conceptual explanations without numbers

---

## Understanding VPOC Components

- **VPOC** (Volume Point of Control): The single price level where the MOST volume traded
- **VAH** (Value Area High): Upper boundary of the 70% volume zone
- **VAL** (Value Area Low): Lower boundary of the 70% volume zone
- **Value Area**: The range between VAH and VAL (where 70% of volume occurred)

## Value Area Movement Combinations

### 1. VAH UP, VAL DOWN, VPOC UP

**What this means:**
- VALUE AREA EXPANDING BOTH DIRECTIONS - Market exploring wide price range

## Machine Learning Feature Encoding

For your ML model, encode these as features:

### Direction Features
```
vah_direction: {UP: 1, FLAT: 0, DOWN: -1}
val_direction: {UP: 1, FLAT: 0, DOWN: -1}
vpoc_direction: {UP: 1, FLAT: 0, DOWN: -1}
price_vs_vpoc: {ABOVE: 1, AT: 0, BELOW: -1}
```

### Divergence Features
```
value_area_divergence = (vah_dir + val_dir) / 2 - vpoc_dir
  +2: VA rising strongly, VPOC falling (fade rally)
  -2: VA falling strongly, VPOC rising (fade drop)
   0: Agreement (trend continuation)

price_vpoc_divergence = price_position - vpoc_dir
  +2: Price above, VPOC rising (strong uptrend)
  -2: Price below, VPOC falling (strong downtrend)
```

### Value Area Features
```
value_area_width = vah - val (absolute)

```

### Volume Distribution Features
```

volume_concentration = volume_at_vpoc / total_volume
  High: Tight consensus
  Low: Dispersed, no consensus
