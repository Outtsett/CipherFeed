# TWAP Band Movement Signals - Complete Reference

**Purpose**: Interpret what different TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price) band movements mean for trading signals

**Format**: Conceptual explanations without numbers

## Understanding TWAP vs VWAP

**TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price)**:
- Simple average of prices over time
- Each price tick weighted equally by TIME
- Ignores volume completely
- Shows pure price movement trend

**VWAP (Volume-Weighted Average Price)**:
- Average of prices weighted by VOLUME
- Large trades have more influence
- Reflects where most MONEY changed hands
- Shows institutional activity

**Key Insight**: TWAP vs VWAP divergence reveals volume distribution patterns
