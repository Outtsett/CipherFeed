## Machine Learning Feature Encoding

For your ML model, encode these as features:

### Direction Features
```
top_band_direction: {UP: 1, FLAT: 0, DOWN: -1}
bottom_band_direction: {UP: 1, FLAT: 0, DOWN: -1}
price_direction: {UP: 1, FLAT: 0, DOWN: -1}
```

### Divergence Features
```
band_price_divergence = (top_band_dir + bottom_band_dir) - (2 × price_dir)
  +4: Bands up, price down (strong mean reversion buy)
  -4: Bands down, price up (strong mean reversion sell)
   0: Agreement (trend continuation)
```

### Volatility Features
```
band_expansion = abs(top_band_dir) + abs(bottom_band_dir)
  2: Both moving (explosion/breakout)
  1: One moving (asymmetric pressure)
  0: Neither moving (compression/squeeze)
```

### Signal Strength
```
signal_strength = abs(band_price_divergence) × band_expansion
  8: Maximum divergence with expansion (strongest signal)
  0: No movement (wait state)
```
